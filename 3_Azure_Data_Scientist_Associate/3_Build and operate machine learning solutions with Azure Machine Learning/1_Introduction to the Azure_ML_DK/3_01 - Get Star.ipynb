In this case, you're running the notebook in a *Conda* environment on an Azure Machine Learning compute instance. This environment is installed in the compute instance by default, and contains common Python packages that data scientists typically work with. It also includes the Azure Machine Learning Python SDK, which is a Python package that enables you to write code that uses resources in your Azure Machine Learning workspace.\n",
