    "To help ensure fast access, Azure Table Storage splits a table into partitions.\n",
    "Partitioning Helps to organize data and improve scalability and performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Table partition](table-partitions.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This scheme enables an application to quickly perform Point queries that identify a single row, and Range queries that fetch a contiguous block of rows in a partition.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a range query, the application searches for a set of rows in a partition, specifying the start and end point of the set as row keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use cases and management benefits of using Azure Table Storage\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary advantages of using Azure Table Storage tables over other ways of storing data include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* It's simpler to scale. It takes the same time to insert data in an empty table, or a table with billions of entries. An Azure storage account can hold up to 5 PB of data.\n",
    "* A table can hold semi-structured data\n",
    "* There's no need to map and maintain the complex relationships typically required by a normalized relational database.\n",
    "* Row insertion is fast\n",
    "* Data retrieval is fast, if you specify the partition and row keys as query criteria\n",
    "  \n",
    "There are disadvantages to storing data this way though, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Consistency needs to be given consideration as transactional updates across multiple entities aren't guaranteed\n",
    "* There's no referential integrity; any relationships between rows need to be maintained externally to the table\n",
    "* It's difficult to filter and sort on non-key data. Queries that search based on non-key fields could result in full table scans"

    "## Explore Azure Blob storage\n",
    "\n",
    "Many applications need to store large, binary data objects, such as images and video streams. Microsoft Azure virtual machines use blob storage for holding virtual machine disk images. These objects can be several hundreds of GB in size.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is Azure Blob storage?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Azure Blob storage is a service that enables you to store massive amounts of unstructured data, or blobs, in the cloud\n",
    "\n",
    "Azure currently supports three different types of blob:\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Block blobs*. A block blob is handled as a set of blocks. Each block can vary in size, up to 100 MB. A block blob can contain up to 50,000 blocks, giving a maximum size of over 4.7 TB. The block is the smallest amount of data that can be read or written as an individual unit. Block blobs are best used to store discrete, large, binary objects that change infrequently.\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Page blobs*. A page blob is organized as a collection of fixed size 512-byte pages. A page blob is optimized to support random read and write operations; you can fetch and store data for a single page if necessary. A page blob can hold up to 8 TB of data. Azure uses page blobs to implement virtual disk storage for virtual machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Append blobs*. An append blob is a block blob optimized to support append operations. You can only add blocks to the end of an append blob; updating or deleting existing blocks isn't supported. Each block can vary in size, up to 4 MB. The maximum size of an append blob is just over 195 GB.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside an Azure storage account, you create blobs inside containers. A container provides a convenient way of grouping related blobs together, and you can organize blobs in a hierarchy of folders, similar to files in a file system on disk.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Blob Container](Blob_container.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Blob storage provides three access tiers, which help to balance access latency and storage cost:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Hot tier\n",
    "* Cool tier\n",
    "* Archive tier\n",
    "\n",
    "Common uses of Azure Blob Storage include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Serving images or documents directly to a browser, in the form of a static website. Visit Static website hosting in Azure storage for detailed information.\n",
    "* Storing files for distributed access\n",
    "* Streaming video and audio\n",
    "* Storing data for backup and restore, disaster recovery, and archiving\n",
    "* Storing data for analysis by an on-premises or Azure-hosted service\n",

    "\n",
    "**What is Azure Cosmos DB?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Azure Cosmos DB is a multi-model NoSQL database management system. Cosmos DB manages data as a partitioned set of documents. A document is a collection of fields, identified by a key. \n",
    "\n",

    "* Cassandra API\n",

    "### Provision other non-relational data services\n",
    "\n",
    "This unit describes how to provision Data Lake storage, Blob storage, and File Storage. As with Cosmos DB, you can provision these services using the Azure portal, the Azure CLI, Azure PowerShell, and Azure Resource Manager templates.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise: Provision non-relational Azure data services\n",
    "\n",
    "In the sample scenario, you've decided to create the following data stores:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A Cosmos DB for holding information about the volume of items in stock. You need to store current and historic information about volume levels, so you can track how levels vary over time. The data is recorded daily.\n",
    "* A Data Lake store for holding production and quality data.\n",
    "* A blob container for holding images of the products the company manufactures.\n",
    "* File storage for sharing reports.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "You can use Azure File storage to store shared files. Users can connect to a shared folder (also known as a file share) and read and write files (if they have the appropriate privileges) in much the same way as they would use a folder on a local machine.\n",
