    "\n",
    "### Describe the characteristics of relational and non-relational data\n",
    "\n",
    "**for relational data**  result of the normalization process is that your data is split into a large number of narrow, well-defined tables (a narrow table is a table with few columns), with references from one table to another.\n",
    "- records sharing the same information are stored once. e.g if customers share same information.\n",
    "\n",
    "**For non relational data** in a document database, you could store the details of each customer in a single document.\n",
    "- Records sharing the same information are duplicated.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Describe transactional workloads**\n",
    "\n",
    "Relational data handle transaction processing., A transaction is a sequence of operations that are atomic. This means that either all operations in the sequence must be completed successfully, or if something goes wrong, all operations run so far in the sequence must be undone.\n",
    "\n",
    "A transactional database must adhere to the ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties to ensure that the database remains consistent while processing transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Atomicity* guarantees that each transaction is treated as a single unit, which either succeeds completely, or fails completely. \n",
    "* *Consistency* e.g. if you add funds to an account, there must be a corresponding deduction of funds somewhere, or a record that describes where the funds have come from if they have been received externally. \n",
    "* *Isolation* ensures that concurrent execution of transactions leaves the database in the same state that would have been obtained if the transactions were executed sequentially.\n",
    "* *Durability* guarantees that once a transaction has been committed, it will remain committed even if there's a system failure such as a power outage or crash.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many systems implement relational consistency and isolation by applying locks to data when it is updated. The lock prevents another process from reading the data until the lock is released. The lock is only released when the transaction commits or rolls back. Extensive locking can lead to poor performance, while applications wait for locks to be released.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many distributed database management systems relax the strict isolation requirements of transactions and implement \"eventual consistency.\" In this form of consistency, as an application writes data, each change is recorded by one server and then propagated to the other servers in the distributed database system asynchronously. While this strategy helps to minimize latency, it can lead to temporary inconsistencies in the data. Eventual consistency is ideal where the application doesn't require any ordering guarantees. Examples include counts of shares, likes, or non-threaded comments in a social media system."

    "\n",
    "**Understand batch processing**\n",
    "\n",
    "Exactly when each group is processed can be determined in a number of ways. For example, you can process data based on a scheduled time interval (for example, every hour), or it could be triggered when a certain amount of data has arrived, or as the result of some other event.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Advantages of batch processing include:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Large volumes of data can be processed at a convenient time.\n",
    "  * It can be scheduled to run at a time when computers or systems might otherwise be idle, such as overnight, or during off-peak hours.\n",

    "\n",
    "  * The time delay between ingesting the data and getting the results.\n",
    "  * All of a batch job's input data must be ready before a batch can be processed. This means data must be carefully checked. "
