    "### Describe the characteristics of relational and non-relational data\n",
    "\n",
    "**for relational data**  result of the normalization process is that your data is split into a large number of narrow, well-defined tables (a narrow table is a table with few columns), with references from one table to another.\n",
    "- records sharing the same information are stored once. e.g if customers share same information.\n",
    "\n",
    "**For non relational data** in a document database, you could store the details of each customer in a single document.\n",
    "- Records sharing the same information are duplicated.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Describe transactional workloads**\n",
    "\n",
    "Relational data handle transaction processing., A transaction is a sequence of operations that are atomic. This means that either all operations in the sequence must be completed successfully, or if something goes wrong, all operations run so far in the sequence must be undone.\n",
    "\n",
    "A transactional database must adhere to the ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties to ensure that the database remains consistent while processing transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Atomicity* guarantees that each transaction is treated as a single unit, which either succeeds completely, or fails completely. \n",
    "* *Consistency* e.g. if you add funds to an account, there must be a corresponding deduction of funds somewhere, or a record that describes where the funds have come from if they have been received externally. \n",
    "* *Isolation* ensures that concurrent execution of transactions leaves the database in the same state that would have been obtained if the transactions were executed sequentially.\n",
    "* *Durability* guarantees that once a transaction has been committed, it will remain committed even if there's a system failure such as a power outage or crash.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many systems implement relational consistency and isolation by applying locks to data when it is updated. The lock prevents another process from reading the data until the lock is released. The lock is only released when the transaction commits or rolls back. Extensive locking can lead to poor performance, while applications wait for locks to be released.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many distributed database management systems relax the strict isolation requirements of transactions and implement \"eventual consistency.\" In this form of consistency, as an application writes data, each change is recorded by one server and then propagated to the other servers in the distributed database system asynchronously. While this strategy helps to minimize latency, it can lead to temporary inconsistencies in the data. Eventual consistency is ideal where the application doesn't require any ordering guarantees. Examples include counts of shares, likes, or non-threaded comments in a social media system."

    "**Understand batch processing**\n",

    "\n",
    "* **Advantages of batch processing include:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Large volumes of data can be processed at a convenient time.\n",

    "\n",
    "  * The time delay between ingesting the data and getting the results.\n",

    "Unstructured data is data that doesn't naturally contain fields. Examples include video, audio, and other media streams.\n",
    "In Azure, you would probably store video and audio data as block blobs in an Azure Storage account.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Describe types of non-relational and NoSQL databases\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is NoSQL?**\n",
    "NoSQL is a rather loose term that simply means non-relational.  Some non-relational databases support a version of SQL adapted for documents rather than tables (examples include Azure Cosmos DB).\n",
    "\n",
    "4 categories of NoSQL:\n",
    "\n",
    "* key-value stores,\n",
    "* document databases,\n",
    "* column family databases\n",
    "* graph databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What is a key-value store?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Each data item in a key-value store has two elements, a key and a value. The key uniquely identifies the item, and the value holds the data for the item. The value is opaque to the database management system. Items are stored in key order.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Key value store](4_4_1_key-value.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "A query specifies the keys to identify the items to be retrieved. You can't search on values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The focus of a key-value store is the ability to read and write data very quickly. Search capabilities are secondary. A key-value store is an excellent choice for data ingestion, when a large volume of data arrives as a continual stream and must be stored immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "Azure Table storage is an example of a key-value store. Cosmos DB also implements a key-value store using the Table API.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What is a document database?**\n",
    "\n",
    "In a document database, each document has a unique ID, but the fields in the documents are transparent to the database management system. Document databases typically store data in JSON format, as described in the previous unit, or they could be encoded using other formats such as XML, YAML, JSON, BSON. \n",
    "Documents could even be stored as plain text.\n",
    "A document store does not require that all documents have the same structure. This free-form approach provides a great deal of flexibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Document](4_4_2_document.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Other document database management systems (such as Cosmos DB) can only read and write entire documents. In these cases, an update replaces the entire document with a new version.\n",
    "Azure Cosmos DB implements a document database approach in its Core (SQL) API.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is a column family database?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A column family database organizes data into rows and columns. Examples of this structure include ORC and Parquet files.\n",
    "\n",
    "The real power of a column family database lies in its denormalized approach to structuring sparse data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This diagram also shows some sample data. In this example, customer 1 and customer 3 share the same address, and the schema ensures that this address information is not duplicated. This is a standard way of implementing a one-to-many relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Relational](4_4_3_relational.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "IF there is consistent request to perform join operations on relational table, then the overhead associated with performing this join operation can quickly become significant if there are a large number of requests and the tables themselves are large.\n",
    "The purpose of a column family database is to efficiently handle situations such as this.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Column family](4_4_4_column-family.png)\n",
    "The illustration above is conceptual rather than physical, and is intended to show the logical structure of the data rather than how it might be physically organized. Each row in a column family database contains a key, and you can fetch the data for a row by using this key.\n",
    "\n",
    "In most column family databases, the column-families are stored separately. In the previous example, the CustomerInfo column family might be held in one area of physical storage and the AddressInfo column family in another, in a simple form of vertical partitioning.\n",
    "The data for a single entity that spans multiple column-families will have the same row key in each column family. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Column family separate](4_4_5_column-family-physical.png) The most widely used column family database management system is Apache Cassandra. Azure Cosmos DB supports the column-family approach through the Cassandra API.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What is a graph database?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Graph databases enable you to store entities, but the main focus is on the relationships that these entities have with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It stores 2 kinds of information: nodes that you can think of as instances of entities, and edges, which specify the relationships between nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "![graph](4_4_6_graph.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can conduct inquiries like: \"Find all employees who directly or indirectly work for Sarah\" or \"Who works in the same department as John?\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Azure Cosmos DB supports graph databases using the Gremlin API. The [Gremlin API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/graph/graph-introduction) is a standard language for creating and querying graphs.\n"

    "\n",
    "**Learning objectives**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this module, you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Learn about data ingestion and processing\n",
    "* Explore data visualization\n",
    "* Explore data analytics\n",
    "\n",
    "## Describe data ingestion and processing\n",
    "\n",
    "![Data Ingestion and processing](5_2_data-process.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is data ingestion?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Data ingestion is the process of obtaining and importing data for immediate use or storage in a database. The data can arrive as a continuous stream, or it may come in batches, depending on the source.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is data processing?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Data processing takes the data in its raw form, cleans it, and converts it into a more meaningful format (tables, graphs, documents, and so on). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Note:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Data cleaning is a generalized term that encompasses a range of actions, such as removing anomalies, and applying filters and transformations that would be too time-consuming to run during the ingestion stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data processing can be complex, and may involve automated scripts, and tools such as Azure Databricks, Azure Functions, and Azure Cognitive Services to examine and reformat the data, and generate models. A data analyst could use machine learning to help determine future trends based on these models.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Data Processing](5_2_2_process-stage.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is ELT and ETL?**\n",
    "\n",
    "ETL stands for Extract, Transform, and Load. The raw data is retrieved and transformed before being saved. It is suitable for systems that only require simple models, with little dependency between items.\n",
    "\n",
    "ELT is an abbreviation of Extract, Load, and Transform. The process differs from ETL in that the data is stored before being transformed.ELT is more suitable for constructing complex models that depend on multiple items in the database, often using periodic batch processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "![ETL vs ELT](5_2_3_etl-vs-elt.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Azure Data Factory is a cloud-based data integration service that allows you to create data-driven workflows for orchestrating data movement and transforming data at scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Explore data visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is reporting?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Reporting shows you what has happened, while analysis focuses on explaining why it happened and what you can do about it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is business intelligence?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Business intelligence systems provide historical, current, and predictive views of business operations, most often using data that has been gathered into a data warehouse, and occasionally working from live operational data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is data visualization?**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are using Azure, the most popular data visualization tool is Power BI.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explore visualization options to represent data**\n",
    "\n",
    "Data visualization helps you to focus on the meaning of data, rather than looking at the data itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Bar and column charts:* Bar and column charts enable you to see how a set of variables changes across different categories.\n",
    "* *Line charts:* Line charts emphasize the overall shape of an entire series of values, usually over time.\n",
    "* *Matrix:* A matrix visual is a tabular structure that summarizes data\n",
    "* *Key influencers:* A key influencer chart displays the major contributors to a selected result or value.\n",
    "* *Treemap:* Treemaps are charts of colored rectangles, with size representing the relative value of each item.\n",
    "* *Scatter:* A scatter chart shows the relationship between two numerical values.\n",
    "* *Filled map:* If you have geographical data, you can use a filled map to display how a value differs in proportion across a geography or region\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Explore data analytics\n",
    "\n",
    "Data analytics is a discipline that covers the entire range of data management tasks. These tasks not only include analysis, but also data collection, organization, storage, and all the tools and techniques used.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Data Analytics](5_3_analytics-table.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Descriptive analytics**\n",
    "\n",
    "Descriptive analytics helps answer questions about what has happened, based on historical data.\n",
    "By developing KPIs (Key Performance Indicators), these strategies can help track the success or failure of key objectives. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Diagnostic analytics**\n",
    "\n",
    "Diagnostic analytics helps answer questions about why things happened. Diagnostic analytics techniques supplement more basic descriptive analytics. They take the findings from descriptive analytics and dig deeper to find the cause.\n",
    "3 steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Identify anomalies in the data. These may be unexpected changes in a metric or a particular market.\n",
    "2. Collect data that's related to these anomalies.\n",
    "3. Use statistical techniques to discover relationships and trends that explain these anomalies.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Predictive analytics**\n",
    "\n",
    "Predictive analytics helps answer questions about what will happen in the future.\n",
    "Techniques include a variety of statistical and machine learning techniques such as neural networks, decision trees, and regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prescriptive analytics**\n",
    "\n",
    "Prescriptive analytics helps answer questions about what actions should be taken to achieve a goal or target. Prescriptive analytics techniques rely on machine learning strategies to find patterns in large datasets. By analyzing past decisions and events, the likelihood of different outcomes can be estimated.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cognitive analytics**\n",
    "\n",
    "Cognitive analytics attempts to draw inferences from existing data and patterns, derive conclusions based on existing knowledge bases, and then add these findings back into the knowledge base for future inferences--a self-learning feedback loop.\n"
