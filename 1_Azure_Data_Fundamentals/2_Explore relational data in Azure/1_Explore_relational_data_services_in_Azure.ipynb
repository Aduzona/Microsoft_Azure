    "**What is provisioning?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Provisioning is the act of running series of tasks that a service provider, such as Azure SQL Database, performs to create and configure a service. Behind the scenes, the service provider will set up the various resources (disks, memory, CPUs, networks, and so on) required to run the service. \n",

    "\n",
    "* The *Azure portal*: most convinient for provisioning.\n",
    "* The *Azure command-line interface (CLI)*: The CLI provides a set of commands that you can run from the operating system command prompt or the Cloud Shell in the Azure portal.\n",
    "* *Azure PowerShell*: Many administrators are familiar with using PowerShell commands to script and automate administrative tasks.\n",
    "* *Azure Resource Manager templates*: An Azure Resource Manager template describes the service (or services) that you want to deploy in a text file, in a format known as JSON (JavaScript Object Notation).\n",
